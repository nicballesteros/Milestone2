# Milestone2
Milestone 2 was an Engineering coding project that took place over the course of a month and a half.
The goal was to find the best way to smooth raw enzyme data into data that is more readable and 
more understandable to investors. We first smoothed the raw data and then we calculated the best
model for it. We also calculated in what concentration would be most effective.

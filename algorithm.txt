1) read all data from csv in main Function
2) main function calls project_function for each enzyme
3) product data is organized in a structure.
4) for each test and duplicate test, project_function finds best model of the product data for the first 500 datapoints and then uses that model to find v0
5) each v0 is plotted onto a plot
6) each v0 is linearized using Hanes-Woolf Linearization
7) a best fit line is found
8) the Km and Vmax are found from this best fit line
9) the Michaelis-Menten model is found from Km and Vmax
10) this model is plotted
11) displays km and vmax to command WINDOW
12) main function saves km and vmax in a matrix
